public class MatchTest {
    /*
     * Testing strategy:  
     *  Note that the only observers of the Match class are matchView, getId, getPlayers, and toString (isMatchOver is a mutator).
     *  All tests for Match should test based on the results from the observers
     *  (Mainly test based of the results from matchView because that is the observer that the game uses)
     *  
     *  Note that tryGuess and challenge both return feedback messages indicating if the
     *  guess/challenge was successful or unsuccessful, and then why it was unsuccessful if so.
     *  Also test based of these feedback messages from these mutators.
     *  
     *  Partition Operations on Match m as follows:
     *  
     *  Guesses:
     *      Guess is consistent with the state of the puzzle:
     *          guess conflicts with previous unconfirmed word that this player entered
     *          guess does not conflict at all
     *      
     *      
     *      Guess is not consistent with the state of the puzzle:
     *          length of guess is not correct
     *          guess is not cosistent with confirmed words in puzzle
     *          guess is not consistent with words entered by other players
     *  
     *  
     *  Challenges:
     *      Challenge satisfies the validity constraints:
     *          the challenged word was originally correct
     *          the challenged word was originally incorrect, the proposed word is correct:
     *              *Include the special case where multiple words that are inconsistent with this correct challenge get cleared 
     *          the challenged word was originally incorrect, the proposed word is also incorrect.
     *      
     *      Challenge does not satisfy the validity constraints:
     *          the challenged word was entered by this player (canâ€™t challenge your own words)
     *          the challenged word was already confirmed
     *          the proposed word is the same as the word already there
     *          the proposed word is not of the correct length
     *          
     *  
     *  Miscellaneous:
     *      test player is added to the game
     *      test game ends when all cells have their correct letters
     *
